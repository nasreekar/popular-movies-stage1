# popular-movies-stage1

In this stage Iâ€™ll build the core experience of your movies app.

This app will:

- Upon launch, present the user with an grid arrangement of movie posters.
- Allow the user to change sort order via a setting:
- The sort order can be by most popular, or by top rated
- Allow the user to tap on a movie poster and transition to a details screen with additional information such as:
  - original title
  - movie poster image thumbnail
  - A plot synopsis (called overview in the api)
  - user rating (called vote_average in the api)
  - release date
